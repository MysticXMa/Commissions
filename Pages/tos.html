        <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; opacity: 0.7">
          Effective Date: February 2026 | Version 3.0
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Welcome!</strong> Please read these Terms carefully. By
          placing an order, you are entering a legally binding agreement to
          comply with the conditions below. You affirm that you are at least 18
          years of age or have parental/guardian consent.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> 1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Engagement of Mystic’s services constitutes a full legal agreement to
        these terms. If you are commissioning on behalf of a minor, you as the
        legal guardian assume all responsibility for the terms outlined herein.
        These terms supersede any prior oral or written agreements.
      </p>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-money-bill-wave"></i> 2. Payment & Financials</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment Options:</strong> Clients may choose between
          <strong>100% Upfront</strong> (priority queue) or a
          <strong>50/50 Split Payment</strong>. Prices are quoted in USD unless
          otherwise specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The 50/50 Policy:</strong> If selecting the split option, the
          first 50% (Non-Refundable Deposit) is due before work begins. The
          remaining 50% is due upon completion,
          <strong>prior to the delivery</strong> of the final files or Unity
          package. An invoice will be provided for the final payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment Gateways:</strong> Cash App, PayPal (Friends &
          Family), Donation Alerts, Gumroad, and Steam Gift Cards. Payments must
          be made in full, covering any platform fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Taxes & Fees:</strong> The client is responsible for all
          transaction fees, currency conversion fees, and any applicable taxes
          in their jurisdiction. Work will be paused if the net amount received
          does not match the agreed price.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Late Payment:</strong> Final payment is due within 7 days of
          completion notification. Failure to pay may result in project
          suspension, late fees (5% per week), and eventual cancellation with
          forfeiture of deposit and completed work.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-undo-alt"></i> 3. Refund & Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds are handled strictly due to the labor-intensive nature of custom
        3D work:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Deposit Non-Refundability:</strong> Under the 50/50 policy,
          the initial 50% deposit is <strong>non-refundable</strong> once work
          (sketching, concepting, asset gathering, or base editing) has
          commenced.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Client-Initiated Cancellation:</strong> If the client cancels
          after work has begun, any payment made is forfeited as compensation
          for time and resources expended. Partial deliverables completed up to
          the point of cancellation may be provided at Mystic's discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Full Refunds:</strong> Only issued if Mystic cancels the
          commission before any work has started.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Refunds:</strong> No refunds are issued for completed
          projects, client bans, VRChat ToS violations, "change of heart,"
          dissatisfaction with aesthetic results (provided they match the agreed
          brief), or inability to use the avatar due to client-side technical
          issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chargeback Policy:</strong> Any unauthorized chargeback or
          dispute filed will result in immediate termination of service,
          blacklisting from future commissions, and the right to pursue legal
          action for damages, including recovery of the disputed amount plus
          associated fees.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> 4. Production, Revisions & Delivery</h2>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Delivery times are estimates, not hard deadlines.
        Complexities or client delays will extend the timeline.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Pack:</strong> ~24 Hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Starter Pack:</strong> ~24-48 Hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Pack:</strong> 2-5 Days.</li>
        <li><strong>Ultimate Pack:</strong> 1 - 2 Weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Celestial Pack:</strong> 2+ Weeks.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Queue:</strong> You will be notified of your "Order Number" in
          the queue. You can request a status update once every 6 hours. Rush
          orders may be available for a 50%+ fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Revision Policy:</strong> Each commission package includes a
          set number of revision rounds (e.g., Minor: 2, Major: 1). Additional
          revisions beyond the included rounds will incur a fee starting at $15
          per revision. "Complete redos" constitute a new commission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delivery Method:</strong> Final assets will be delivered via a
          secure link (Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer) or directly through
          Discord. It is the client's responsibility to download and backup
          files promptly. Links expire after 30 days.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i> 5. Intellectual Property, Licensing &
        AI
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Creator's IP:</strong> Mystic retains all copyright,
          trademark, and intellectual property rights to the original artistic
          work, including but not limited to custom textures, sculpts,
          blendshapes, shaders, and unique design elements created during the
          commission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Use License:</strong> You are granted a perpetual,
          non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to
          <strong>use</strong> the avatar for personal, non-commercial purposes
          within VRChat and other virtual reality social platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commercial Use:</strong> Commercial use (streaming, videos,
          promotional content) is permitted. Resale, redistribution, or use in
          for-profit projects outside of social VR requires a separate,
          negotiated Commercial License Agreement and additional fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Resale/Redistribution:</strong> You may not flip, resell,
          gift, loan, lease, sublicense, or distribute the files/Unity package
          to others. You may not upload the avatar to public databases or avatar
          worlds without explicit written permission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Base Model & Third-Party Assets:</strong> The client is
          responsible for securing and complying with the licenses of any base
          models, assets, or components they provide. Mystic's license only
          covers the work performed by Mystic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Prohibition:</strong> Under no circumstances may the
          delivered textures, sculpts, designs, or any project files be used to
          train, develop, or contribute to AI models, machine learning
          algorithms, or Generative AI datasets. This is a strict prohibition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Credit:</strong> While not mandatory, client credit is
          appreciated when showcasing the avatar publicly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        <i class="fas fa-file-shield"></i> 6. Asset Ownership Proof & Legality
      </h2>
      <p class="note">
        <strong>Anti-Piracy & Ethics:</strong> I do not work with "leaked,"
        pirated, or fraudulently obtained assets. All work must be legal and
        ethical.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clients must provide clear proof of purchase/license for any base
          models, textures, or assets used in the commission (e.g., receipt,
          Unitypackage file, Gumroad library link).
        </li>
        <li>
          Failure to provide proof within 48 hours of request will result in
          immediate project suspension and potentially termination without
          refund.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a client is found to have provided fraudulent or pirated assets
          after commission completion, Mystic reserves the right to revoke the
          delivery and blacklist the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          The client warrants that all provided references, concepts, and
          materials do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of
          third parties (e.g., copyrighted characters, trademarks).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> 7. Confidentiality & Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        All personal information (email, name, payment info) and project details
        will be kept confidential, unless explicitly waived by the client.
        Mystic may showcase non-confidential work for portfolio or promotional
        purposes unless the client requests privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients may request their project to be kept private (NDA) for an
        additional fee, which must be agreed upon before work begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Client information is retained for 12 months after project completion
        for tax and record-keeping purposes, unless requested to be removed
        earlier in writing, subject to legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> 8. Communication Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Primary communication will be via email, Discord, or a previously
          specified platform. All major approvals should be given in writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          The creator reserves the right to decline or terminate communication
          that is inappropriate, abusive, harassing, or threatening.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feedback & Response Time:</strong> Clients should provide
          feedback and approvals in a timely manner (within 72 hours for minor
          stages, 5 days for major approvals) to avoid significant delays.
          Failure to respond for 30 days may result in project termination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mystic's typical response time is within 48 hours on business days
          (Monday-Friday, excluding holidays).
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients are responsible for keeping contact information updated and
          checking their provided communication channels regularly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> 9. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide clear, accurate descriptions, visual references, and all
          necessary assets promptly at the project start.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure all provided assets are legally owned or licensed, free from
          third-party rights claims, and safe for use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm base model ownership with verifiable proof.
          <strong>Failure is grounds for cancellation.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that the project concept and references do not violate platform
          TOS (e.g., VRChat's Community Guidelines) or promote hate, illegal
          activities, or explicit adult content beyond platform allowances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide structured feedback during revision rounds; vague feedback
          ("make it better") is not actionable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that their system meets the requirements for using and
          uploading the final avatar to VRChat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Backup all delivered files. Mystic is not a file hosting service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> 10. Limitations of Liability
        & Disclaimers
      </h2>
      <p>Mystic's liability is strictly limited as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The avatar is provided "as is." No warranties, express or implied, are
          given regarding merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
          non-infringement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mystic is not responsible for technical issues with VRChat, Unity,
          SteamVR, Oculus, or other third-party platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not responsible for client dissatisfaction due to unclear
          instructions, changing requirements mid-project, or subjective
          aesthetic preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not liable for loss of data, assets, or revenue caused by client
          errors, system failures, or acts of God.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not responsible for issues stemming from platform updates, changes, or
          future incompatibilities. Avatar functionality is guaranteed only for
          the VRChat SDK version current at the time of delivery.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not liable for problems caused by client or third-party modifications
          after delivery.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not responsible for client bans or disciplinary actions taken by
          VRChat or other platforms due to client behavior or avatar usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total liability for any claim related to the commission shall not
          exceed the total amount paid by the client for the specific commission
          in question.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> 11. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law
      </h2>
      <p>
        The primary method for dispute resolution is direct, good-faith
        communication between both parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        If unresolved, both parties agree to seek mediation with a neutral third
        party before pursuing any legal action. The costs of mediation will be
        shared equally.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >This agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the
          laws of the United Kingdom.</strong
        >
        Any legal actions or proceedings must be initiated in the courts located
        within the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any legal actions must be initiated within one (1) year of the date the
        dispute arose, or the claim is permanently barred.
      </p>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-ban"></i> 12. Termination</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Either party may terminate the agreement if the other materially
          breaches its terms and fails to cure the breach within 14 days of
          written notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payment for all work completed and expenses incurred up to the
          termination date remains due immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mystic reserves the right to cease work immediately, without notice,
          for violations of asset legality, harassment, non-payment, or failure
          to provide critical information for over 30 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon termination for cause by Mystic, the client forfeits all payments
          and rights to any work in progress. Upon termination for cause by the
          client, Mystic may, at their discretion, provide completed work and
          invoice for it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Survival: Sections on Payment, Intellectual Property, Refunds,
          Limitation of Liability, and Dispute Resolution shall survive
          termination.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> 13. Privacy & Data Handling (GDPR/CCPA
        Notice)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Client data (contact info, payment details, project files) is collected
        solely for fulfilling the commission, invoicing, and providing support.
        Data is stored on secured, password-protected systems and encrypted
        cloud storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data will not be sold or shared with third-party marketers. It may be
        shared only with essential service providers (e.g., payment processors)
        under strict confidentiality agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients in the EEA, UK, or California have rights to access, rectify, or
        request erasure of their personal data, subject to legal obligations.
        Requests should be sent via email.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of a data breach that compromises client data, affected
        clients will be notified within 72 hours of discovery.
      </p>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i> 14. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>
        Mystic is not liable for delays or failure to perform caused by events
        beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to: natural
        disasters, pandemics, war, terrorism, government actions, internet or
        power grid failures, major hardware/software failure, or serious
        illness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such events, timelines will be extended accordingly, and both parties
        will work cooperatively to adjust the schedule.
      </p>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-box-open"></i> 15. Project Acceptance & Testing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The client has a <strong>7-day inspection period</strong> from the
          date of final delivery to test the avatar thoroughly and report any
          bugs or deviations from the agreed specifications.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 7 days without any reported, verifiable issues, the project is
          deemed formally accepted by the client, and the final payment (if not
          already made) is immediately due.
        </li>
        <li>
          Requests for changes or fixes after the acceptance period may be
          treated as a new support request or commission and may incur fees.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> 16. Support & Modification Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Included Support:</strong> Basic technical support related to
          the delivered work (e.g., clarification on implementation, minor bug
          fixes that are the creator's fault) is provided for
          <strong>14 days</strong> after final acceptance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Excluded Support:</strong> Support does NOT include teaching
          software (Blender, Unity), fixing issues caused by client
          modifications, updating the avatar for new VRChat SDKs, fixing
          problems with third-party assets, or making aesthetic changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Modifications After Delivery:</strong> Any requests for
          modifications, additions, or updates after final delivery and the
          support period will be quoted as a separate commission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extended Support Plan:</strong> An ongoing support/maintenance
          plan may be purchased for a recurring fee, covering updates for a
          defined period.

          <strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> This document constitutes the
          entire agreement between client and Mystic, superseding all prior
          discussions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amendments:</strong> These terms may be updated. The terms in

          govern that specific project.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is found invalid or
          unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and
          effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Waiver:</strong> Failure to enforce a right or provision does
          not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assignment:</strong> The client may not assign or transfer
          this agreement without Mystic's prior written consent. Mystic may
          assign this agreement to a successor entity.
