        <i class="fas fa-copyright"></i> 5. Usage Rights & Intellectual Property
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Commissioned avatars are for <strong>personal use only</strong> unless
          explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Redistribution, resale, or commercial use requires separate licensing
          and may incur additional fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients may not claim the avatar as their own creation. Proper credit
          to Mystic is required where applicable.

        <li>
          <strong
            >Clients may not modify, reverse engineer, or resell the avatar for

          additional charges.

        <li>
          Major deviations from initial scope will be treated as separate
          commissions.
